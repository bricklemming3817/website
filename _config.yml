  i write software with purpose. for me, building is about shaping ideas into tools that make life simpler and more meaningful.
  each project is a reflection of curiosity, imagination, and the pursuit of happiness.

  this space is where i share what i create â€” ongoing explorations of how technology can align with thought, design, and intent.
