# Simple Personal Site

This repository contains a small static website built with plain HTML and CSS. The homepage shows a short bio, contact links, and a list of projects. Each project has its own HTML page with a brief description and details.

## Structure

- `index.html` – homepage
- `projects/` – individual project pages
- `style.css` – shared styles

There is no build step or dependency. To deploy, serve these files with any static web host.
